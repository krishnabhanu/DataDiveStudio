Welcome to Data Dive Studio! This repository is a comprehensive showcase of my Data Analyst projects, designed to demonstrate practical applications of SQL, data visualization, Python, and various other data analysis tools on public datasets.

What You'll Find Here:

- SQL Projects: Explore structured queries that extract and analyze data from complex databases.
- Data Visualization: Dive into visual projects using Tableau, Power BI, and Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful and impactful representations of data.
- Python Notebooks: Engage with Python Jupyter notebooks that offer detailed explorations of data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis techniques.
- Tools and Techniques: Discover how to leverage additional tools and methodologies in data analysis to enhance your skill set and project outcomes.
- Public Datasets: Get hands-on with an array of public datasets, ranging from government statistics to social media data, all used to illustrate various data analysis challenges and solutions.

Objective: This repository aims to not only display my capabilities in data analytics across multiple platforms and programming languages but also to serve as a resource for others who are looking to learn and apply data analysis techniques in their projects.
